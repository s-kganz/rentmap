# Rent Map

A common rule of thumb for renters is to not spend more than 25% of their income on housing costs. As the cost of housing in the United States continues to rise, this criterion becomes harder and harder to realize. This project visualizes median rent data by county from HUD. Work is associated with RPI's Xinformatics class in spring 2021.

## Setup
 - Get an R environment set up. Using RStudio is easiest. 
 - Install the dependencies: `install.packages(c("shiny", "leaflet", "sf"))`
 - Run `shiny_demo.R`.
